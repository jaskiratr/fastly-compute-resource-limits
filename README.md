Testing Fastly Compute resource limits

This repository contains elementary code for simulating excess platform resource limit consumption for Fastly Compute. It was written so we can observe what the end user experience is like. We can see the output in the Compute and Observability dashboards, as well as log-tail and user's log endpoints.
